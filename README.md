# hacep-ci-image
This project is used to quickly prototype using kafka to replace AMQ and DataGrid in hacep project:
https://github.com/redhat-italy/hacep


This repository contains an image to rapidly run jvm playground hacep project for continuous integration.

I made it for integration tests, so that I can change the AMQ and DataGrid, without regression on specifications.
